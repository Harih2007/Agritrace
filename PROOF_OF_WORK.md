```

### Method 2: Live Demo (Best - 2 minutes)

1. Start your app:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. Open: http://localhost:3001/farmer

3. Click "View On-chain" on any product

4. Browser opens SnowTrace showing REAL blockchain data

5. Say: "See? This is the actual Avalanche blockchain. Not mock data."

### Method 3: QR Code Demo (Most Impressive - 1 minute)

1. In your app, click "Generate QR" on any product

2. Show the QR code on your screen

3. Have them scan it with their phone

4. Their phone opens the blockchain explorer

5. Say: "No app needed - goes straight to the blockchain!"

2. [Click View On-chain] "Watch this button"
3. [Browser opens SnowTrace] "This is the actual Avalanche blockchain"
4. [Point to contract address] "Anyone can verify this contract"
5. [Generate QR] "Consumers scan this QR code"
6. [Scan with phone] "And it opens the blockchain record"
7. [Show camera] "The scanner uses live camera feed"

### Closing (15 seconds):
"Everything is publicly verifiable. Here's the contract address if you want to check: 0x8bb1D4dE341096dBAd6384d965256d94dA4D8590"

## 💬 Handling Questions

**Q: "How do I know this is real?"**
> "Click this link: testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x8bb1D4dE341096dBAd6384d965256d94dA4D8590
> That's Avalanche's official blockchain explorer. You can see the contract, the deployment, everything."

**Q: "Can I test it myself?"**
> "Absolutely! Run the app, click any 'View On-chain' button, and you'll see the blockchain explorer open. Or scan a QR code with your phone - it goes straight to the blockchain."

**Q: "Is this on mainnet?"**
> "It's on Fuji testnet, which is Avalanche's public test network. Same technology as mainnet, but free to use for testing. Perfect for demonstrations."

**Q: "How much did deployment cost?"**
> "Testnet is free - you get test AVAX from a faucet. For mainnet deployment, it would cost a few dollars in gas fees."
